# AI Python to C++ Code Conversion

This project uses Python's **Gradio** framework along with AI models
such as **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and **OpenAI OSS-120B** to convert Python
code into optimized, efficient C++ code based on your system
specifications for local execution.

Foe getting the system specifications, call **retrieve_system_info()** defined in the **system_info.py** file

The generated C++ code is saved as **main.cpp** automatically.

If your machine cannot compile or run the generated C++ code, you can
use an online compiler instead:

**Online C++ Compiler:**\

You can also compare execution time by running the generated code 
online for the codes obtaine by both the models.
